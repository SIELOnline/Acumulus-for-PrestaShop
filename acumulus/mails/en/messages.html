<p>Dear madam, sir,</p>

<p>On sending an invoice to Acumulus, some errors or warnings occurred.</p>
<p>If the send state below equals "2 {status_2_text}",
  warnings were returned, but the invoice has been created in Acumulus. However,
  we advice you to check the invoice in Acumulus for correctness.</p>
<p>If the send state equals "1 {status_1_text}" or
  "3 {status_3_text}", errors were returned and the invpoice has NOT been created.
  You will have to manually create the incvoice in Acumulus or adapt it in your
  web shop and resend it to Acumulus.</p>
<table>
  <tr><td>Send state:</td><td>{status} {status_text}.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Order:</td><td>{order_id}</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Invoice:</td><td>{invoice_id}</td></tr>
</table>
